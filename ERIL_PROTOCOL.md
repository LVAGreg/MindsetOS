# ERIL v2 Protocol — MindsetOS

**Every ERIL agent follows these exact steps. No deviations.**

ERIL = Evaluate → Research → Implement → Loop

---

## Step 0 — Pre-flight: filter the rubric to your task

Read `/data/workspace/ECOS/apps/mindset-os/EVALUATION_CRITERIA.md`.

Identify which anti-pattern classes apply to your task:

| If your task involves... | Check these classes |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| API calls / fetch / endpoints | `cross-file-mismatch` — verify URL against real-backend.cjs |
| Colors / design / tokens | `token-violation` — verify against design token reference table |
| Buttons / icons / interactive elements | `accessibility` — aria-labels required |
| `catch` blocks / async operations | `silent-failure` — every catch needs UI feedback |
| Props passed to child components | `integration-gap` — verify at every call site |
| HTMLElement style mutations | `typescript` — cast to HTMLElement |
| Mobile layout / touch | `mobile` — flex-wrap, tap targets ≥44px |
| Three.js / WebGL | `webgl` — geometry ownership, RAF cleanup |

**Mandatory cross-file checks (do these BEFORE writing any code):**

1. **API endpoints**: For every `fetch('/api/...')` or `apiClient.get('/api/...')` you will write, grep `real-backend.cjs` for the registered path. If the path doesn't match exactly, you have a bug before you start.

2. **Response field names**: For every `res.data.fieldName` you will write, read the backend route handler's response object to confirm `fieldName` exists.

3. **Color values**: For every hex color you write, verify it against the design token table in EVALUATION_CRITERIA.md. The 9 canonical tokens are: `#09090f`, `rgba(18,18,31,0.8)`, `#1e1e30`, `#ededf5`, `#9090a8`, `#5a5a72`, `#4f6ef7`, `#fcc824`, `#7c5bf6`. Any other hex is off-token unless it's an opacity variant of one of these.

## Step 1 — Screenshot (when visual context helps)

Use Playwright to navigate the production site and take a screenshot.
Only required for UI-facing components. Skip for backend-only work.

---

## Step 2 — Read before writing

Read every file you will modify. Read files your code will call into.
Never edit a file you haven't read.

---

## Step 3 — Score your implementation against the actual rubric

Use the scoring template from EVALUATION_CRITERIA.md. Score all 10 criteria:

```
UI
  Originality:        /10  (target ≥8)
  Quality of Design:  /10  (target ≥8)
  Craft:              /10

Agent Experience (if applicable)
  Conversation Feel:  /10  (target ≥8)
  Context Persistence:/10

Code
  Simplicity:         /10
  Correctness:        /10

UX
  User Intent:        /10  (target ≥8)
  Mobile Readiness:   /10
```

For backend-only work (no UI), score only: Functionality, Simplicity, Correctness.

**Scoring rules:**
- If ANY `blocker:yes` anti-pattern applies to your code → VERDICT: REVISE regardless of score
- If ANY starred criterion (★) scores < 8 → VERDICT: REVISE
- If ANY criterion scores < 7 → VERDICT: REVISE
- Otherwise → VERDICT: YES

---

## Step 4 — Near-miss log

After scoring, note any patterns that ALMOST failed — where you caught something before it became a bug. These are candidates for new rubric entries.

Format: `NEAR-MISS: [what you caught] → [class it would belong to]`

---

## Step 5 — VERDICT

```
VERDICT: YES | REVISE
Score: X.X/10 (average of applicable criteria)
Blockers: (list any criterion <7 or blocker:yes anti-pattern hit)
Near-misses: (list any patterns you caught pre-emptively)
Files created/modified: (list)
```

## Design Token Reference (quick lookup)

| Token | Value | Use |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Background deep | `#09090f` | Page backgrounds |
| Background card | `rgba(18,18,31,0.8)` | Cards, panels |
| Border | `#1e1e30` | All borders |
| Text primary | `#ededf5` | Headings |
| Text secondary | `#9090a8` | Body |
| Text muted | `#5a5a72` | Timestamps |
| Accent blue | `#4f6ef7` | Primary actions |
| Accent amber | `#fcc824` | Free tier / CTAs |
| Accent purple | `#7c5bf6` | Premium |

**Off-token values to reject immediately:**
`#f59e0b`, `#eab308`, `#8b5cf6`, `#6366f1`, `#6b7280`, `#475569`, `#64748b`, `#1a1a2e`, `#e2e8f0`, `#16213e`

---

## High-confidence anti-patterns (hits ≥ 5) — always check these

These fire in almost every loop. Check them regardless of task type:

1. **Off-token amber** (`#f59e0b` or `#eab308` instead of `#fcc824`) — grep every color value you write
2. **Silent failure** — every `catch` block must call `setError()` or equivalent
3. **Partial token migration** — if you touch a file, grep it for `gray-*`, `indigo-*`, `violet-*`, `dark:*`
4. **Missing aria-labels** — every icon-only button needs `aria-label`
5. **HTMLElement cast** — every `.style` mutation needs `as HTMLElement`
6. **flex-wrap missing** — every row of buttons/pills needs `flex-wrap: wrap` or `flex-wrap`

## What V5 checks that ERIL agents miss

V5 independently reviews all ERIL output. It specifically looks for:
- Cross-file URL/field/column mismatches (ERIL agents writing in isolation can't see these)
- AGENT_HEX maps with off-token values copied from existing files
- Props added to a component but never wired at the call site
- Security issues in string rendering paths

Knowing V5 exists is not a reason to be less careful — it's a reason to be more careful, because V5's findings block the entire loop.

---

## V5 post-loop update duty

After V5 runs, it must:
1. Increment `hits` on every anti-pattern entry it caught
2. Update `last_caught` to the current loop number
3. Append any new patterns it found that aren't in the file
4. Update the Class Index counts at the bottom of EVALUATION_CRITERIA.md
